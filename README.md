### Waste Classification Using CNN
This project aims to automate the classification of waste into categories such as recyclable, non-recyclable, and organic using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the project provides an efficient solution for waste management, helping reduce manual effort and improve recycling processes.


#### Objective
To build a robust and accurate machine learning model that identifies the type of waste based on images and contributes to sustainable waste disposal practices.

#### Highlights
- Use of a CNN-based deep learning model for image classification.
- Preprocessing of datasets to enhance training and ensure high accuracy.
- Real-world applications in smart waste management and recycling systems.
